Difference between Shadcn and Bootstrap framework.
1.
-> In Bootstrap, we can't create any custom component or edit any component.
-> In Shadcn, we can, like if we create a button, then we also add a new variant in that button.

2.
In Bootstrap not know the internal js code of that component. like responsive navbar component etc..
In ShadCN, give full code when installing the component and use it also it is also customizable.
