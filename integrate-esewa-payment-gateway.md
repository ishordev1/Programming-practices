# Integrate eSewa Payment Gateway

Create an order and redirect to a specific URL, but also send the following data from the server to the frontend:
- Total price  
- Order ID  
- Description  

Take that data in the frontend, create a form automatically, and redirect to the payment gateway URL (given in eSewa docs) after 2 seconds.
